# One-Sample T-Test and Paired T-Test

In short, the choice of t-test depends on your number of samples.

## Comparison

### One-Sample Sign Test
- compares the mean of a single sample against a specific value (like population mean)
- problem examples in [t-test.pdf](t-test.pdf):
    * comparison of math ability of year 2008 and year 2007 students

### Paired T-Test
- compares the mean of two related samples or the same sample measured at two different times
- by taking pairs of observations, subtracting one from the other, we can conduct a one-sample t-test on the differences
- problem examples in [t-test.pdf](t-test.pdf):
    * effectiveness of blood pressure treatment
